Benchmarking system for paper recommendation
With the growth in the number of technologies and research being undertaken in each subject, it is difficult to discover the research paper most relevant to our interest. Because so many research papers are being published at the moment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to confirm the legitimacy of the research papers that are being published. It is necessary to follow and examine the research papers cited and cited by the research paper at hand to do more in- depth research on a certain issue.
The main aim of this work is to create a hybrid content and collaborative- based recommendation system that offers the most appropriate research paper to researchers based on content similarity and the collaborative nature of citations and references.
In this study, we describe a Recommenders Benchmarking system that will be utilized as a decision assistance tool for evaluating the most relevant pa- pers for a certain query and data and as an infrastructure for recommender system development. The framework provides an intuitive graphical user inter- face and a rich collection of efficient recommendation algorithms. To do this, we included several hybrid recommendation algorithms into the benchmarking system, allowing researchers and students to apply them in their systems.
